## Overview of NSGA-II Algorithm

*You can find the full details of the algorithm in the [my pdf](https://github.com/abolfazlaghdaee/AI_Project/blob/main/Section2%3A%20Research%20NGSA-II/Section2_%20NSGA-II.pdf) file.*

NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) is a popular multi-objective optimization algorithm. It is an evolutionary algorithm that uses a form of genetic representation and fitness-based selection to guide the search for optimal solutions. It is particularly well-suited for problems where the goal is to optimize multiple conflicting objectives.

### Key Concepts of NSGA-II

- **Non-dominated Sorting**: NSGA-II uses non-dominated sorting to classify the population into different fronts based on Pareto dominance.
- **Crowding Distance**: To maintain diversity in the population, crowding distance is used as a measure of how close an individual is to its neighbors.
- **Selection, Crossover, and Mutation**: These genetic operators are used to generate new candidate solutions from the current population.
