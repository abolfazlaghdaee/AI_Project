# The first Section is solving the problem by using NSGA-II:




"""Please Read my explanation:

1- Initialize a population of candidate solutions.
2- valuate the population based on the objective functions.
3- Perform non-dominated sorting to identify the Pareto fronts.
4- Assign a crowding distance to individuals to maintain diversity.
5- Generate new offspring through selection, crossover, and mutation.
6- Combine the offspring with the parent population.
7- Repeat steps 2-6 for multiple generations.
8- Select the final set of solutions from the last Pareto front as the optimal solutions.
